The allowance should be re-evaluated at the end\nof each fiscal year and at interim periods, as necessary, to ensure that it reflects the agency's best estimate of the net\nrealizable value of accounts receivable. The estimate should be based on an analysis of both individual accounts and\ngroups of accounts, as appropriate. The analysis should be based on historical collection experience, adjusted for\nchanges in current conditions, and, when appropriate, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future conditions.\nAccounts that represent individual amounts, e.g., greater than $1 million, should be individually analyzed to\ndetermine the likelihood of collection. All other accounts can be analyzed on a group basis. In addition to historical\nexperience, the analysis should consider such factors as the age of the receivable, the type of debtor, and other\napplicable factors, including possible sources. including laws, government, state, contractors and other significant\ninformation.\nThe write-off allowance for losses generally cannot be based solely on the results of individual account analysis, as\nthis may not provide a reasonable estimate of the amount that will actually be collected. In such cases, the agency\nshould use group analysis, based on historical experience and adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts.\nProtocol for Estimating Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts\nMedicare accounts receivable must be analyzed to determine whether each account is collectible or in order to\nreduce the allowance for uncollectible accounts to the agency's best estimate of the net realizable value of accounts\nreceivable. The analysis should be based on both individual and group analysis, as appropriate. The analysis should\nconsider historical collection experience. adjusted for changes in current conditions, and, when appropriate,\nreasonable and supportable forecasts of future conditions.\nMedicare accounts that meet materiality thresholds are analyzed for uncollectibility on an account-by-account basis.\nGroup analysis should be used for all other accounts.
